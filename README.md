# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This is a fun and interactive progressive web app built using React.js to visualize sorting algorithms such as bubble, insertion, selection, merge, quick, and heap.

## Overview

Sorting Visualizer is a great tool for visual learners who want to understand how sorting algorithms work in a more interactive way. It is also perfect for anyone who wants to improve their coding skills by exploring different algorithms and how they function.

Getting Started
Before you can use Sorting Visualizer, you need to have Node.js installed on your local system. If you don't already have it, you can download it from the official website.

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these simple steps to create a new React app and get started:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

  
### npm start

Once you've created your app, simply run `npm start` to run it in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically if you make edits, and you'll see any lint errors in the console.
